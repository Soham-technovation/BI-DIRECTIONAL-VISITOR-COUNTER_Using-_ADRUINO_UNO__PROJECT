# BI-DIRECTIONAL-VISITOR-COUNTER_Using-_ADRUINO_UNO__PROJECT
The Bi-Directional Visitor Counter is a project designed to accurately count and display the number of visitors entering and exiting a designated area.
This system utilizes sensors to detect movement in both directions, providing real-time data on foot traffic. The project aims to enhance visitor management and improve safety protocols in various environments such as museums, offices, and public spaces.

Key Features:

Real-Time Counting: Tracks visitors entering and exiting simultaneously.
Data Visualization: Displays visitor counts on a user-friendly interface.
Sensor Integration: Utilizes motion sensors for accurate detection.
Data Logging: Records visitor data for analysis and reporting.
Alerts and Notifications: Sends alerts when visitor thresholds are reached.
Technologies Used:

Microcontrollers (e.g., Arduino, Raspberry Pi)
Motion Sensors (e.g., PIR sensors)
Programming Languages (e.g., Python, C++)
Data Visualization Tools (e.g., Grafana, D3.js)
Installation Instructions:

Clone the repository: git clone <repository-url>
Install required libraries and dependencies.
Connect the sensors to the microcontroller as per the schematic.
Upload the code to the microcontroller.
Launch the data visualization interface.
Usage:

Deploy the system in the desired location.
Monitor visitor counts through the interface.
Analyze data for trends and insights.
